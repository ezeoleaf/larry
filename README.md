Larry is a Golang cli bot that tweets random Github repositories.

## Disclaimer

I hold no liability for what you do with this bot or what happens to you by using this bot. Abusing this bot *can* get you banned from Twitter, so make sure to read up on [proper usage](https://support.twitter.com/articles/76915-automation-rules-and-best-practices) of the Twitter API.

## Running bots

- [GolangRepos](https://twitter.com/GolangRepos): Tweets repositories from Github that contain the "golang" topic
- [RustRepos](https://twitter.com/RustRepos): Tweets repositories from Github that contain the "rust" topic
- [MLRepositories](https://twitter.com/MLRepositories): Tweets repositories from Github that contain the "machine-learning" topic
- [CryptoRepos](https://twitter.com/CryptoRepos): Tweets repositories from Github that contain the "crypto" topic

## Installation

You can install Larry by cloning the repo and using `go install`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ezeoleaf/larry.git
cd larry/cmd/larry
go install
```

You can also use make for building the project and generating an executable:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ezeoleaf/larry.git
cd larry
make build
```

Or you can just run it on the go
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ezeoleaf/larry.git
cd larry
go run . [options]
```

## Usage

### Configuring the bot

Before running the bot, you must first set it up so it can connect to Github and Twitter API.

To do this, you will need to setup the following environment variables:
```
- GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN
- TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
- TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET

If you want the content to be publish in a README file on a repo, you also need these variables
- GITHUB_PUBLISH_REPO_OWNER (Your Github username)
- GITHUB_PUBLISH_REPO_NAME (The name of the repo where your README is. It has to be public)
- GITHUB_PUBLISH_REPO_FILE (By default is README)
```

For generating Github access token you can follow this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)

For getting Twitter keys and secrets you can follow this [guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/guide)

#### Note: You will have to generate both consumer and access pair of keys/tokens and secrets.

### Providers and Publishers

For information on publishers and providers click [here](PublishersAndProviders.md)
#### Providers (where the information is coming from)

| Name         | Key    | Environment Variables |
|--------------|:------:|-----------------------|
| Github       | github |   GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN |

_NOTE: The key is used in the --provider or --pr option_

#### Publishers (where the information is going to be posted)

| Name         | Key     | Environment Variables | Observation |
|--------------|:-------:|----------------------| -------------|
| Twitter      | twitter | TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY<br>TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET | |
| Github       | github  | GITHUB_PUBLISH_REPO_OWNER<br>GITHUB_PUBLISH_REPO_NAME<br>GITHUB_PUBLISH_REPO_FILE | For now it is only going to be posted in the README file and the repository must be **public** |

_NOTE: The key is used in the --publisher or --pub option_

### Running the bot

To run the bot, you have two ways.

If you have installed the bot, you can run it using
  `larry [options]`

If you want to run it without installing it globally you can use
  `go run . [options]`

Example:

`larry -h`

As a response you will see the entire options available

&nbsp;&nbsp;`larry --lang rust --time 15`

For running the bot for Golang every 15 minutes and specifying a blacklist file named blacklist.txt

&nbsp;&nbsp;`larry --topic golang --time 15 --blacklist ./blacklist.txt`

For running the bot every 60 minutes using the "contentfile" provider and JSON file for content

&nbsp;&nbsp;`larry --time 60 --provider contentfile --content-file ./content.json`

For running the bot every 60 minutes using the "contentfile" provider to read CSV file for content and skipping the header record

&nbsp;&nbsp;`larry --time 60 --provider contentfile --content-file ./content.csv --skip-csv-header`


## Content Files

The `contentfile` provider serves content from CSV and JSON files.

### JSON Content File

When the `contentfile` provider receives a `content-file` filename with a `.json` extension, the provider serves random content from the JSON file. This file consists of an array of objects in the following format. ExtraData is an array of strings.

```
[{
	"Title": "larry",
	"Subtitle": "Larry üê¶ is a bot generator that publishes random content from different providers built in Go",
	"URL": "github.com/ezeoleaf/larry",
	"ExtraData": ["68", "ezeoleaf", "golang"]
}]
```

### CSV Content File

When the `contentfile` provider receives a `content-file` filename with a `.csv` extension, the provider serves random content from the CSV file. Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes. The ExtraData strings start at field 4 of the record and a record can contain any number of elements. 

The following file has one record with three ExtraData strings.

```
The title,The subtitle,URL,ExtraString1,"ExtraString2,has comma",ExtraString3
```

An example CSV file with a header record followed by one record:

```
Title,Subtitle,URL,Stars,Author,Language,ExtraData1,ExtraData2,ExtraData3
larry,Larry üê¶ is a bot generator that publishes random content from different providers built in Go,github.com/ezeoleaf/larry,68,ezeoleaf,golang
```

Note: Every record in the CSV file, including the header record, must have the same number of fields otherwise an error will occur. This means if the records will have a variable number of ExtraData fields, each record having fewer than the maximum ExtraData fields must include empty ExtraData fields to match the maximum.

## Blacklist File

### Github Provider

For the `github` provider, the optional blacklist file consists of numeric GitHub repository IDs to exclude from the publishing process. These IDs can be found on the GitHub repository page source in the meta tag `octolytics-dimension-repository_id`.

An example blacklist file containing GitHub repository IDs. The file can contain comments using the # character, everything on the line after this character is ignored.

```
# Blacklisted repositories
123 # description of the respository
456
```

### Contentfile Provider

For the `contentfile` provider, the optional blacklist file consists of content titles to exclude from the publishing process.
